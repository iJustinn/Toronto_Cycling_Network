# Toronto_Cycling_Network

This study examines the evolution of Toronto’s cycling infrastructure, analyzing the installation dates, upgrades, and comfort levels of bike lanes from 2001 to 2024. By investigating trends in infrastructure expansion, the research places particular emphasis on the varying comfort levels of different lane types, providing insights into how well the network accommodates cyclists. Additionally, the spatial distribution of bike lanes is assessed, uncovering disparities in access between downtown and suburban areas. The findings underscore the importance of continued investment in both the quality and expansion of cycling infrastructure to support sustainable transportation in Toronto. 

## Paper Overview

This paper tlized data from [Open Data Toronto](https://open.toronto.ca/). This data repository provides comprehensive information on [Toronto’s cycling infrastructure](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/cycling-network/), including details on installation dates, types of lanes, and upgrades. As a key source for urban planning and public engagement, Open Data Toronto offers open access to critical datasets that are essential for analyzing the development and spatial distribution of the city’s bike lanes. The detailed analysis was conducted using `R` programming and is presented as a final research paper in `PDF` format.
