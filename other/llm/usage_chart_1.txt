In R, provide the code for how you clean data and generate charts (in two separate code blocks) of the "Number Of Bikeways Installed By Year" chart. Do similar things as this cleaning and charting process:


#### Clean data 2 ####
# Upgrade data
# Load the dataset
data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/raw_data.csv")

# Select and clean the 'UPGRADED' column, then summarize by year
upgraded_data <- data %>%
  select(UPGRADED) %>%                     # Keep only the 'UPGRADED' column
  filter(!is.na(UPGRADED) & UPGRADED > 1800) %>%  # Remove NA and invalid years
  mutate(UPGRADED = as.numeric(UPGRADED)) %>% # Convert 'UPGRADED' to numeric
  group_by(UPGRADED) %>%                    # Group by the upgrade year
  summarise(num_lanes = n())                # Count the number of upgrades per year

# Save the summarized data
write_csv(
  x = upgraded_data,
  file = "data/analysis_data/upgraded_data.csv"
)


#### Chart 2 ####
# Upgraded
# Load the data
upgraded_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/upgraded_data.csv")

# Generate the bar chart for "Number of Bikeways Upgraded by Year"
ggplot(upgraded_data, aes(x = UPGRADED, y = num_lanes)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "grey") +
  labs(title = "Number of Bikeways Upgraded by Year",
       x = "Year of Upgrade",
       y = "Number of Bikeways") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(upgraded_data$UPGRADED), max(upgraded_data$UPGRADED), by = 1)) +  # Display all years
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotates x-axis labels for readability

# Save Chart

Here are the two R code blocks for cleaning and generating the chart for the "Number of Bikeways Installed by Year," similar to the process you provided.

Clean Data
r
Copy code
#### Clean data ####
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
cycling_data <- read_csv("data/raw_data/cycling_data.csv")

# Select and clean the 'INSTALLED' column, then summarize by year
installed_data <- cycling_data %>%
  select(INSTALLED) %>%                        # Keep only the 'INSTALLED' column
  filter(!is.na(INSTALLED) & INSTALLED > 1800) %>%  # Remove NA and invalid years
  mutate(INSTALLED = as.numeric(INSTALLED)) %>%     # Convert 'INSTALLED' to numeric
  group_by(INSTALLED) %>%                          # Group by the installation year
  summarise(num_bikeways = n())                    # Count the number of bikeways per year

# Save the summarized data
write_csv(
  x = installed_data,
  file = "data/analysis_data/installed_data.csv"
)
Generate Chart
r
Copy code
#### Chart ####
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Load the summarized data
installed_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/installed_data.csv")

# Generate the bar chart for "Number of Bikeways Installed by Year"
ggplot(installed_data, aes(x = INSTALLED, y = num_bikeways)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "grey") +
  labs(title = "Number of Bikeways Installed by Year",
       x = "Year of Installation",
       y = "Number of Bikeways") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(installed_data$INSTALLED), max(installed_data$INSTALLED), by = 1)) +  # Display all years
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotates x-axis labels for readability

# Save Chart

This code block mirrors the steps of cleaning the data and generating the chart, tailored to the "INSTALLED" column.
