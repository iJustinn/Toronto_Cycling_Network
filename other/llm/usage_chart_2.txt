revise this chart, make the bar part and line part into two charts, also add a straight trend line to the line part:

#### Chart 2 ####
# Upgraded
# Load the data
upgraded_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/upgraded_data.csv")

# Generate the bar chart for "Number of Bikeways Upgraded by Year" with a line connecting each point
ggplot(upgraded_data, aes(x = UPGRADED, y = num_lanes)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgrey") +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1), color = "black", size = 1) +  # Adds a line connecting each point
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 2) +  # Adds points at each data value
  labs(title = "Number of Bikeways Upgraded by Year",
       x = "Year of Upgrade",
       y = "Number of Bikeways") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(upgraded_data$UPGRADED), max(upgraded_data$UPGRADED), by = 1)) +  # Display all years
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotates x-axis labels for readability

# Save Chart

Here's the revision of the chart into two separate charts: one bar chart and one line chart with a trend line added.

Bar Chart Code
R
Copy code
# Load the data
upgraded_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/upgraded_data.csv")

# Generate the bar chart for "Number of Bikeways Upgraded by Year"
ggplot(upgraded_data, aes(x = UPGRADED, y = num_lanes)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgrey") +  # Bar chart
  labs(title = "Number of Bikeways Upgraded by Year",
       x = "Year of Upgrade",
       y = "Number of Bikeways") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(upgraded_data$UPGRADED), max(upgraded_data$UPGRADED), by = 1)) +  # Display all years
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotates x-axis labels for readability

# Save the bar chart
ggsave("other/charts/upgrade_bar.jpg")
Line Chart Code with Trend Line
R
Copy code
# Generate the line chart with trend line for "Number of Bikeways Upgraded by Year"
ggplot(upgraded_data, aes(x = UPGRADED, y = num_lanes)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1), color = "black", size = 1) +  # Adds a line connecting each point
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 2) +  # Adds points at each data value
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +  # Adds a linear trend line
  labs(title = "Trend of Bikeways Upgraded by Year",
       x = "Year of Upgrade",
       y = "Number of Bikeways") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(upgraded_data$UPGRADED), max(upgraded_data$UPGRADED), by = 1)) +  # Display all years
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotates x-axis labels for readability

# Save the line chart
ggsave("other/charts/upgrade_line.jpg")
This code splits the original combined chart into a bar chart and a line chart. The line chart includes a red trend line using geom_smooth() with a linear model fit (method = "lm"), which helps visualize the overall trend in the data over the years. Adjustments for saving files have been made accordingly to reflect each chart type.

do the same thing for this chart:

#### Chart 3 ####
# Installed
# Load the data
installed_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/installed_data.csv")

# Generate the bar chart for "Number of Bikeways Installed by Year" with a line connecting each point
ggplot(installed_data, aes(x = INSTALLED, y = num_bikeways)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgrey") +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1), color = "black", size = 1) +  # Adds a line connecting each point
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 2) +  # Adds points at each data value
  labs(title = "Number of Bikeways Installed by Year",
       x = "Year of Installation",
       y = "Number of Bikeways") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(installed_data$INSTALLED), max(installed_data$INSTALLED), by = 1)) +  # Display all years
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotates x-axis labels for readability

# Save Chart

Here's how you can revise the chart into two separate charts: a bar chart and a line chart with a trend line added for the data on "Number of Bikeways Installed by Year."

Bar Chart Code
R
Copy code
# Load the data
installed_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/installed_data.csv")

# Generate the bar chart for "Number of Bikeways Installed by Year"
ggplot(installed_data, aes(x = INSTALLED, y = num_bikeways)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgrey") +  # Bar chart
  labs(title = "Number of Bikeways Installed by Year",
       x = "Year of Installation",
       y = "Number of Bikeways") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(installed_data$INSTALLED), max(installed_data$INSTALLED), by = 1)) +  # Display all years
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotates x-axis labels for readability

# Save the bar chart
ggsave("other/charts/installed_bar.jpg")
Line Chart Code with Trend Line
R
Copy code
# Generate the line chart with trend line for "Number of Bikeways Installed by Year"
ggplot(installed_data, aes(x = INSTALLED, y = num_bikeways)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1), color = "black", size = 1) +  # Adds a line connecting each point
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 2) +  # Adds points at each data value
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +  # Adds a linear trend line
  labs(title = "Trend of Bikeways Installed by Year",
       x = "Year of Installation",
       y = "Number of Bikeways") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(installed_data$INSTALLED), max(installed_data$INSTALLED), by = 1)) +  # Display all years
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotates x-axis labels for readability

# Save the line chart
ggsave("other/charts/installed_line.jpg")
This setup separates the bar chart and the line chart, adding clarity by focusing on different aspects of the data. The line chart includes a linear trend line that highlights the trend over time, providing a clear visual representation of how installations have evolved each year.
