## Development of Toronto's Cycling Infrastructure

The results highlight Toronto's phased approach to developing its cycling infrastructure, with a significant spike in installations in the early 2000s, as shown in @fig-installed. This surge is likely because the dataset started recording from 2001, hence all installations before was counted towards 2001. Futher, the fact that goverment start taking this record and the large number of installations at this period may have reflected political will and public demand for greener transportation alternatives, driven by growing concerns about climate change and urban congestion.

However, after the initial surge, the number of bikeways installed annually began to decline, a pattern that persists to this day. Several factors could explain this decline. First, the initial phase of the bike plan likely focused on areas where cycling infrastructure could be installed with relative ease, particularly in downtown Toronto, where road networks and urban density supported such investments. As the network expanded into more complex areas, such as suburban neighborhoods with fewer existing roadways, the pace of installation slowed. Additionally, the physical limitations of available space in a highly developed urban area may have constrained further expansion, as new bikeways would require more complicated and costly measures, such as road reallocation or shared-use paths.

Despite this slowdown in new installations, @fig-upgraded demonstrates a significant focus on upgrading existing infrastructure, particularly in later years. This shift from installation to upgrades could indicate a strategic pivot by the city toward improving the quality and safety of existing cycling infrastructure. As infrastructure ages and new safety standards emerge, upgrading older lanes becomes crucial to ensuring the network remains usable and safe for cyclists. The peak of upgrades in 2015, for example, might reflect the city's response to increased cycling activity, demands from advocacy groups, or the implementation of updated cycling policies that prioritize safer and more modern designs, such as protected bike lanes.

This pattern of prioritizing upgrades over new installations also suggests that Toronto's initial expansion may have left some areas with suboptimal or unsafe infrastructure, particularly in the form of shared roadways or painted bike lanes that offer minimal protection to cyclists. As urban transportation planning evolves, the focus has shifted toward creating more separated and protected lanes, which are essential for encouraging cycling among less experienced riders, families, or those concerned about safety. This ongoing commitment to improving the infrastructure—rather than merely expanding it—reflects a maturation in Toronto’s approach to active transportation, as planners recognize that quality and safety are just as important as quantity when promoting cycling as a viable mode of transport.

Finally, another crucial aspect linked to the decline in installations could be budgetary constraints or competing infrastructure projects. As urban budgets are stretched across various priorities—public transit expansion, road maintenance, and green space development—the pace of installing new cycling lanes might slow. However, the investment in upgrades suggests that cycling infrastructure remains a priority, even if the focus has shifted from expansion to refinement. Continuing to monitor and analyze these trends will be essential for understanding how Toronto can balance its need for both new installations and the improvement of existing cycling routes to meet its long-term sustainability and mobility objectives.

In conclusion, the first discussion point highlights the evolution of Toronto’s cycling infrastructure from an initial phase of rapid expansion to a more recent focus on upgrading and enhancing the safety and quality of the network. This shift reflects the challenges of balancing growth with maintenance, the need to adapt to changing urban landscapes, and the influence of global best practices and local advocacy in shaping the city’s cycling future.

Development of Toronto's Cycling Infrastructure
The data reveals a phased development of Toronto's cycling infrastructure, with a notable increase in installations during the early 2000s, as shown in @fig-installed. This rise is likely due to the dataset commencing in 2001, thereby consolidating all installations prior to this year. Additionally, the onset of formal record-keeping and the significant number of installations during this period may reflect political momentum and public demand for environmentally sustainable transportation alternatives, influenced by growing concerns over climate change and urban congestion.

Following this initial surge, the annual number of new bikeway installations began to decrease, a trend that continues. Several factors may account for this decline. In the early stages, the city's cycling plan likely targeted areas where infrastructure could be installed with relative ease, particularly in downtown Toronto, where road networks and urban density favored such investments. As the network extended into more complex regions, such as suburban areas with fewer existing roadways, the rate of installation slowed. Moreover, the physical limitations of space in a densely developed urban environment likely constrained further expansion, as new bikeways would require more complex and expensive measures, such as road reallocation or the creation of shared-use paths.

Despite this slowdown in new installations, @fig-upgraded demonstrates a substantial focus on upgrading existing infrastructure, particularly in recent years. This shift from new installations to upgrades may indicate a strategic decision by the city to enhance the quality and safety of the current cycling infrastructure. As the infrastructure ages and new safety standards are introduced, upgrading older lanes is essential to ensuring the network remains functional and safe for cyclists. The peak of upgrades in 2015, for instance, may reflect the city's response to increased cycling activity, advocacy group demands, or the adoption of updated cycling policies that prioritize safer designs, such as protected bike lanes.

The shift toward prioritizing upgrades over new installations also suggests that the initial expansion left certain areas with inadequate or unsafe infrastructure, particularly in the form of shared roadways or painted bike lanes offering minimal cyclist protection. As urban transportation planning evolves, the emphasis has shifted toward constructing more segregated and protected lanes, which are vital for encouraging cycling among less experienced riders, families, or individuals concerned about safety. This ongoing focus on improving infrastructure—rather than simply expanding it—reflects a more advanced approach to active transportation, recognizing that safety and quality are equally important to increasing cycling participation.

Another significant factor contributing to the reduction in new installations may be budgetary limitations or competition from other infrastructure projects. As urban budgets are allocated across multiple priorities—such as public transit expansion, road maintenance, and green space development—the rate of installing new cycling lanes may decline. However, the continued investment in upgrades suggests that cycling infrastructure remains a priority, even if the focus has shifted toward refinement rather than expansion. Ongoing monitoring and analysis of these trends will be important for understanding how Toronto can balance the need for both new installations and improvements to existing cycling routes to meet long-term sustainability and mobility objectives.

In conclusion, the analysis highlights the progression of Toronto’s cycling infrastructure from an initial phase of rapid expansion to a more recent emphasis on upgrading and enhancing the safety and quality of the network. This evolution reflects the complexities of balancing growth with maintenance, the need to adapt to changing urban environments, and the influence of international best practices and local advocacy in shaping the future of cycling in Toronto.

## Comfort Level and Cyclist Safety

The comfort level classification of Toronto's cycling infrastructure offers valuable insights into the quality of the city's bike network, particularly with respect to cyclist safety and usability. As shown in @fig-comfort-one, the majority of bikeways fall into the Low or High Comfort categories, with Moderate Comfort lanes—typically those offering relatively protected infrastructure—making up a smaller proportion of the overall network. This distribution suggests that, Toronto has successfully expanded the sheer number of bikeways, the majority could offer the protection and comfort necessary to encourage broader and more consistent usage. However, it is better to see Low Comfort level lanes taking the smallest portion among all.

The classification of cycling lanes into different comfort levels is important because it directly affects who feels confident enough to cycle. Low Comfort lanes, often painted bike lanes or shared roadways, offer minimal physical separation from motor vehicles, making them less appealing to risk-averse cyclists. The lack of protection increases the perceived danger, discouraging people from cycling regularly, particularly in areas with high traffic volumes. For example, a cyclist may feel comfortable using a Low Comfort lane in a quiet residential neighborhood but avoid it entirely on a busy downtown street where traffic and intersections pose greater hazards.

Moderate Comfort lanes, which typically include designated bike lanes, offer more safety but still lack the physical separation provided by protected or High Comfort infrastructure. These lanes are a step in the right direction but may not sufficiently address concerns about safety, particularly in areas with fast-moving or congested vehicle traffic. Moderate Comfort lanes are likely to attract more cyclists than Low Comfort lanes, but they may not be enough to significantly increase ridership across all demographic groups. For instance, studies have shown that women, children, and older adults are particularly sensitive to perceived danger in cycling, and without sufficient protection, these groups are less likely to use the infrastructure regularly.

High Comfort lanes, on the other hand, provide the greatest potential for encouraging cycling across a broad range of demographics. These lanes, often in the form of protected bike lanes or multi-use paths, offer a physically separated space for cyclists, reducing the likelihood of accidents involving motor vehicles. Research from cities that have invested heavily in High Comfort infrastructure, such as Amsterdam or Copenhagen, indicates that the availability of such protected lanes is a key factor in increasing overall cycling rates and making cycling a more viable and appealing transportation option for all. In Toronto, however, as the analysis shows, only a small proportion of the network is classified as High Comfort. This limits the extent to which the city can fully leverage its cycling infrastructure to promote widespread, sustained usage.

The low proportion of High Comfort lanes can be partly attributed to the early phases of Toronto's cycling infrastructure development, during which the focus was likely on quickly installing a large number of lanes to meet political and public demands. At that time, lower-cost solutions like painted bike lanes and sharrows (shared roadways) were easier and faster to implement than more expensive, space-consuming, and structurally complex protected lanes. However, these lanes did not necessarily provide the level of safety needed to support a significant increase in cycling activity, particularly among more cautious cyclists. The subsequent shift towards upgrading infrastructure, as discussed earlier, is likely an acknowledgment of the limitations of the initial approach, where quantity may have been prioritized over quality.

Moreover, the analysis reveals that many of Toronto's Moderate and Low Comfort lanes have yet to be upgraded, as shown in @fig-comfort-one-2 and @fig-comfort-two. For both Low and Moderate Comfort lanes, over 75% have not been upgraded, which implies that much of the city's existing cycling network still operates under outdated or less protective standards. This points to a significant gap between the current state of Toronto's cycling infrastructure and the standards that are increasingly being recognized as necessary to make cycling a mainstream mode of transportation in urban environments. The failure to upgrade a larger portion of these lanes may stem from budgetary constraints, political will, or challenges in reallocating road space in already congested or car-dominated areas.

One of the most critical implications of these findings is that Toronto’s cycling infrastructure might not yet be sufficiently robust to meet the city’s broader goals of reducing car dependency, lowering emissions, and promoting healthier, more active lifestyles. To truly shift a significant portion of the population towards cycling, the city will need to invest more heavily in upgrading its infrastructure, particularly in transitioning more of its Low and Moderate Comfort lanes into High Comfort lanes. This is especially important in areas where traffic volume and speed are higher, as these conditions pose greater risks to cyclists and deter people from choosing bikes as a mode of transportation.

Another potential reason for the focus on Moderate and Low Comfort lanes is the spatial distribution of the city’s bikeways. As mentioned earlier when showing the result of @fog-map, much of Toronto’s cycling network is concentrated in the downtown core, where road space is at a premium. Installing protected lanes in these areas often requires taking road space away from cars, which can be politically and technically challenging. In contrast, suburban areas, where road space is more abundant, could offer better opportunities for the city to build High Comfort infrastructure. Expanding the reach of the cycling network into these suburban areas, while upgrading the comfort levels of existing downtown lanes, could have a transformative effect on overall cycling rates and help make cycling a viable option for longer commutes.

In conclusion, while Toronto has made considerable progress in expanding its cycling infrastructure, the comfort level analysis reveals that much of the network remains suboptimal for ensuring safety and encouraging more widespread use. To achieve its sustainability and transportation goals, the city must focus on upgrading its existing Low and Moderate Comfort lanes and prioritize the construction of High Comfort infrastructure. This shift will be crucial not only for improving safety but also for making cycling an attractive option for a more diverse range of residents, thereby promoting equity and inclusivity in urban transportation.

Comfort Level and Cyclist Safety
The comfort level classification of Toronto's cycling infrastructure provides valuable insights into the quality of the city's bike network, particularly concerning cyclist safety and usability. As illustrated in @fig-comfort-one, the majority of bikeways fall into either the Low or High Comfort categories, while Moderate Comfort lanes—those offering relatively more protection—comprise a smaller portion of the overall network. This distribution indicates that, while Toronto has expanded its network, many bikeways may lack the necessary protection to encourage consistent and widespread use. Ideally, the proportion of Low Comfort lanes should remain the smallest among all categories.

The classification of cycling lanes based on comfort is crucial, as it directly influences who feels confident enough to cycle. Low Comfort lanes, such as painted bike lanes or shared roadways, provide minimal physical separation from motor vehicles, making them less appealing to risk-averse cyclists. The absence of protection increases the perceived danger, deterring regular cycling, especially in areas with high traffic volumes. For example, a cyclist might feel safe using a Low Comfort lane in a quiet residential neighborhood but avoid it entirely in a busy downtown area with heavy traffic and complex intersections.

Moderate Comfort lanes, which typically include designated bike lanes, offer some safety improvements but still lack the physical separation provided by protected, High Comfort infrastructure. While these lanes may attract more cyclists than Low Comfort lanes, they may not sufficiently address safety concerns in high-traffic areas. Research indicates that groups such as women, children, and older adults are particularly sensitive to perceived danger, and without adequate protection, these groups may be less likely to use the infrastructure regularly.

High Comfort lanes, which provide the highest level of safety, hold the greatest potential for encouraging cycling among a broader demographic. These lanes, often consisting of protected bike lanes or multi-use paths, offer a physically separated space for cyclists, significantly reducing the risk of collisions with motor vehicles. Studies from cities with extensive High Comfort infrastructure, such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen, show that protected lanes are critical for increasing cycling rates and making cycling a more appealing transportation option for all. However, in Toronto, only a small proportion of the network is classified as High Comfort, limiting the city's ability to fully promote cycling.

The limited proportion of High Comfort lanes may be attributed to the early stages of Toronto's cycling infrastructure development, where the focus was likely on rapidly installing a large number of lanes to meet political and public demands. At that time, lower-cost solutions like painted bike lanes and sharrows (shared roadways) were easier and faster to implement than the more complex, expensive protected lanes. However, these lanes did not provide the necessary safety improvements to significantly increase cycling activity, particularly among more cautious cyclists. The recent shift toward upgrading infrastructure suggests an acknowledgment of these limitations, where quantity was initially prioritized over quality.

Further analysis reveals that many of Toronto's Moderate and Low Comfort lanes remain unupgraded, as demonstrated in @fig-comfort-one-2 and @fig-comfort-two. Over 75% of both Low and Moderate Comfort lanes have not been updated, indicating that a substantial portion of the city's cycling network still operates under outdated or less protective standards. This gap between current infrastructure and the standards required to make cycling a mainstream mode of transportation suggests that the city's network may not yet be robust enough to support its broader goals of reducing car dependency, lowering emissions, and promoting active lifestyles.

Budgetary limitations, political challenges, and the difficulty of reallocating road space in congested areas may explain the slow pace of upgrades. While the majority of Toronto's cycling network is concentrated in the downtown core—where road space is limited—installing protected lanes often necessitates taking space away from cars, which can be politically and technically challenging. In contrast, suburban areas with more available road space offer greater potential for the development of High Comfort infrastructure. Expanding the network into these suburban regions, while upgrading existing downtown lanes, could significantly boost overall cycling rates and make cycling a viable option for longer commutes.

In conclusion, while Toronto has made progress in expanding its cycling infrastructure, the comfort level analysis highlights the need for further improvements. Much of the network remains suboptimal for ensuring safety and encouraging widespread use. To meet its sustainability and transportation objectives, the city must prioritize upgrading Low and Moderate Comfort lanes and focus on constructing more High Comfort infrastructure. This transition is essential for improving safety, promoting equity in urban transportation, and making cycling an attractive option for a more diverse range of residents.

## Comfort Level and Cyclist Safety

The comfort level classification of Toronto's cycling infrastructure offers important insights into the city's ability to promote cycling safety and widespread use. According to the Bikeway Comfort Level Distribution, @fig-comfort-one-1, a substantial portion of the cycling network consists of lanes classified as either High or Low Comfort, with Moderate Comfort lanes constituting a smaller percentage of the network. This distribution suggests that while Toronto has made strides in expanding its bike lanes, the infrastructure may not yet provide the protection needed to foster consistent cycling across a broader demographic. The ideal scenario would see Low Comfort lanes forming the smallest proportion of the network, which would ensure safer and more accessible routes for cyclists of all abilities.

Comfort classification is pivotal for determining which segments of the population feel safe cycling. Low Comfort lanes, which include painted bike lanes and shared roadways, offer minimal physical protection from vehicular traffic. This limited separation often discourages risk-averse cyclists from using the lanes, especially in areas with high vehicle volumes. A cyclist might use such a lane in quieter residential neighborhoods but may avoid it in busier downtown streets. Unfortunately, as shown in @fig-comfort-one-2, 77.31% of these lanes remain unupgraded, highlighting a significant gap in the infrastructure's ability to provide safe and comfortable cycling conditions.

Moderate Comfort lanes, which offer a higher degree of separation but still lack full physical barriers, also face similar issues. @fig-comfort-two-1 detailing Moderate Comfort Lanes reveals that 76.62% of these lanes remain unupgraded. This poses a significant challenge for attracting cyclists in busier, more traffic-heavy areas, where perceived risk remains high. These lanes, though better than Low Comfort options, may still not be sufficient for cyclists who are particularly sensitive to safety concerns, such as women, children, and older adults.

The significant percentage of unupgraded lanes across all comfort levels reflects a broader challenge within Toronto’s infrastructure development. Many of the city's bike lanes were likely installed in a period when the focus was on expanding the network quickly, relying on lower-cost options such as painted lanes or shared roadways. While these solutions helped establish the city's cycling network, they did not address the need for safety, especially for more cautious cyclists.

The slow pace of upgrades could be attributed to several factors, including budgetary constraints, political challenges, and the technical difficulties associated with reallocating road space in high-traffic areas. In downtown Toronto, where most of the network is concentrated, installing protected lanes often requires reducing car lanes, a politically challenging task. On the other hand, suburban areas, which offer more road space, present opportunities for future development of High Comfort infrastructure. Expanding into these regions and upgrading downtown lanes could significantly improve overall cycling rates and promote cycling for longer commutes.

In conclusion, while Toronto's cycling network has expanded, its current state, as demonstrated by the distribution of unupgraded lanes, underscores the need for further improvements. The city must prioritize upgrading its Low and Moderate Comfort lanes while continuing to expand High Comfort infrastructure. This shift will not only enhance safety but also promote greater equity in urban transportation, making cycling a viable and attractive option for a more diverse group of residents.

The geospatial analysis of Toronto's cycling infrastructure, as visualized in @fig-map, highlights both the strengths and gaps within the city's bike network. One of the most prominent observations is the dense concentration of bikeways in the downtown core. This dense network aligns with expectations, given that downtown Toronto is the city's most populated and congested area, with the highest demand for alternative transportation options. The high density of bikeways in the downtown region reflects a focused effort to make cycling a viable and accessible mode of transportation for residents, commuters, and visitors in this area.

However, the map also exposes the substantial disparity in infrastructure coverage as one moves away from the city center into more suburban and peripheral areas. In these regions, cycling infrastructure is sparse, which highlights the unequal access to safe and efficient bike routes. This limited infrastructure in suburban areas can reduce the overall utility of the city's cycling network, as it disproportionately benefits those living in the urban core. Suburban residents, often facing longer commutes and more reliance on automobiles, would likely benefit from an expanded bike lane network that could offer a safer and more convenient alternative to driving.

This discrepancy in cycling infrastructure can be attributed to several factors. Suburban areas typically have lower population densities and roadways designed for car travel, which have historically made cycling less of a priority in urban planning. Moreover, suburban cultures often tend to rely heavily on cars, leading to lower public demand for bike lanes in these areas. As Toronto seeks to promote sustainable transportation and reduce car dependency, prioritizing the development of safe cycling routes in suburban areas will be crucial. Expanding this infrastructure into outer neighborhoods can play a significant role in supporting the city's broader transportation and environmental objectives.

@fig-map also highlights the role of recreational areas, especially the areas near lakes (bottom right 'coastline'), in shaping the cycling network. These areas often feature multi-use trails that provide High Comfort lanes, offering cyclists scenic and safe routes away from motor traffic. This is also another important function of bike lanes besides commuting, providing people with a good environment for exercise and relaxation.

Finally, the map underscores opportunities for future expansion. Areas with few or no cycling routes could be targeted for infrastructure development, particularly in locations where there is sufficient road space or public demand for safer cycling options. As Toronto grows, it will be important to address these gaps in the cycling network to ensure that all residents—regardless of their location—have access to safe, comfortable, and convenient cycling infrastructure. By doing so, the city can move toward a more equitable and sustainable transportation system that benefits a larger portion of the population.

In summary, the spatial distribution of Toronto's cycling infrastructure reveals a well-connected downtown area, but highlights the need for further investment in suburban regions. Expanding the network to underdeveloped areas will be critical for making cycling a more practical and widely adopted form of transportation throughout the city.
