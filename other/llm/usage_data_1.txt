Here’s an example of how you can simulate a dataset for the Toronto Cycling Network in R with 100 rows and some plausible columns:

r
Copy code
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(304)

# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Create a simulated dataset for Toronto Cycling Network
toronto_cycling_network <- data.frame(
  route_id = 1:100,  # Unique identifier for each cycling route
  route_name = paste("Route", 1:100),  # Route name
  length_km = round(runif(100, 0.5, 20), 2),  # Random route lengths between 0.5 and 20 km
  bike_lanes = sample(c("Yes", "No"), 100, replace = TRUE),  # Whether the route has dedicated bike lanes
  surface_type = sample(c("Asphalt", "Concrete", "Gravel"), 100, replace = TRUE),  # Surface type
  ward = sample(1:25, 100, replace = TRUE),  # Randomly assign routes to one of Toronto's wards
  year_installed = sample(1990:2023, 100, replace = TRUE),  # Year the route was installed
  maintenance_status = sample(c("Good", "Fair", "Poor"), 100, replace = TRUE),  # Current maintenance status
  avg_daily_riders = round(rnorm(100, mean = 300, sd = 100))  # Average daily riders (normally distributed)
)

# Display the dataset
print(toronto_cycling_network)
Explanation of columns:
route_id: Unique identifier for each cycling route.
route_name: A simple naming convention for each route.
length_km: Simulated route lengths, randomly generated between 0.5 and 20 kilometers.
bike_lanes: Indicates whether the route has dedicated bike lanes ("Yes" or "No").
surface_type: The type of surface for the route (randomly assigned as "Asphalt", "Concrete", or "Gravel").
ward: The ward number in which the route is located (randomly chosen from 25 wards).
year_installed: The year the route was installed (random year between 1990 and 2023).
maintenance_status: The current status of the route's maintenance ("Good", "Fair", or "Poor").
avg_daily_riders: The average number of daily riders, simulated with a normal distribution around 300 riders per day.
You can copy this code into an R environment and run it to simulate your dataset with 100 rows!

Here’s a revised version of your dataset simulation where different distributions are applied to generate data for various columns:

r
Copy code
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(304)

# Create a simulated dataset for Toronto Cycling Network
toronto_cycling_network <- data.frame(
  route_id = 1:100,  # Unique identifier for each cycling route
  route_name = paste("Route", 1:100),  # Route name
  length_km = round(rgamma(100, shape = 2, scale = 2), 2),  # Gamma distribution for route length (right-skewed)
  bike_lanes = sample(c("Yes", "No"), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.7, 0.3)),  # 70% chance of bike lanes
  surface_type = sample(c("Asphalt", "Concrete", "Gravel"), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.3, 0.1)),  # Asphalt is more common
  ward = sample(1:25, 100, replace = TRUE, prob = dpois(1:25, lambda = 12) + 0.01),  # Poisson distribution for ward, centered around 12
  year_installed = sample(1990:2023, 100, replace = TRUE, prob = dnorm(1990:2023, mean = 2010, sd = 8)),  # More routes in recent years
  maintenance_status = sample(c("Good", "Fair", "Poor"), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)),  # 50% chance of "Good" maintenance
  avg_daily_riders = round(rlnorm(100, meanlog = log(300), sdlog = 0.4))  # Log-normal distribution for daily riders
)

# Display the dataset
print(toronto_cycling_network)
Key Changes:
length_km: Now generated from a Gamma distribution (shape = 2, scale = 2), which gives a right-skewed distribution suitable for real-world measurements like route lengths.
bike_lanes: Probability adjusted to 70% "Yes" and 30% "No", as bike lanes might be more common in a city network.
surface_type: Asphalt is the most common surface type (60%), followed by Concrete (30%) and Gravel (10%).
ward: A Poisson distribution is used to simulate ward numbers, with lambda = 12, meaning wards closer to 12 are more likely.
year_installed: A normal distribution with more recent installations (centered around 2010) and some older routes.
avg_daily_riders: A log-normal distribution is used, which reflects the fact that most routes might have a moderate number of riders, but a few routes might have significantly higher usage.
This revised dataset uses more realistic statistical distributions for generating the data.
